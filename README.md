This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
AWS_PROFILE=opus yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.tsx`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

The application assumes a profile called _opus_ by default. The profile can be changed by editing the AWS_PROFILE environment variable in the [.env](/.env) file. The user should have the following acccess:

- s3://opus-logic-holaplex-storefronts - READ/WRIE objects

A local database can be booted within a docker container using
docker-compose. Run the
following commands to start a database, load schema, and seed with demo
storefront.

```
docker-compose up -d
yarn db:schema:push
yarn db:seed
```
